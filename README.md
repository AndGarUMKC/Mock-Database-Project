# Mock-Database-Project
This project is developed for the CS 3000 Database class and focuses on designing and implementing a one-to-one identification relationship between tables to store customer information and their orders. The goal is to create a robust database system that efficiently manages customer data and their corresponding orders.


The project is divided into three phases, each building upon the previous one to gradually develop a complete and functional database system. The files provided in this repository correspond to these phases.
